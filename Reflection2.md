It has only been a month since the last reflection so I want to be straightforward and say that not much has changed. The list I provided for reflection 1’s first question was just some options I considered in high school. So referring to that list for this reflection will be a bit hard seeing as that list does not exist. Although what I can do is list a few options on my mind right now and explain my attraction to them. 

Software Engineering - At usf the path I feel directed towards is swe, but I don’t think I would be interested in it long term. What I do think could be a possible path is starting here to build my technical skill then transferring to a Program or Project Manager position.

Program Management - I liked the aspect of communicating with customers and figuring out how a certain project can be fixed/developed to cater to their needs.

I do want to venture out from these two options a bit more. In my journey of looking for jobs/internships and the time spent with my CES mentor I have found that there are many other career paths that are available to me, and I plan to explore them further.

To be less vague, one of the things on my mind has been working in animation, but I was unsure if I would be qualified for it. After a talk with my mentor, I decided to not be too fixated on the title of jobs and the intimidation I feel, but instead research where I could fit. In doing so I found the Animation Software Engineer role that blends technical skills that I have/ can easily learn and a creative aspect that I have been longing for. 

I know it isn’t much but finding this option has eased my mind about possible career paths.
