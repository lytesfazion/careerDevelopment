A major takeaway from the article was that I have to set explicit takeaway goals for my relationship with my mentor. I can admit that I was a bit nervous for a mentor relationship because I didn't know what my role entailed besides asking questions, and that seemed one-sided. I think setting these mutual goals will give us direction and releave some of the stress around "what to talk about" or "what to ask". 

Speaking of the relationship being one sidded, something the article mentioned was collaborating. It didn't say too much on the matter but just reading a bit reasured me that I would be walking into a collaborating environment, not one where I was bombarding my mentor with questions as if they were a search bar.



# Part 2: Questions to ask mentor

1. Do you have any experience mentoring? Do you have a mentor? If yes, what is your relationship like with your mentor?
2. What do you hope to gain out of this expeience?
3. Why are you on this career path? If you could, would you change anything about this journey?

Why did I choose these questions?

  Because I believe intention is everything and that by learning what motivated my mentor to be apart of this program in the first place I would gain insight on who they are.
