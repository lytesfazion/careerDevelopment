Event: Intern Pannel

Back in October Alark reached out to ask if I would be interested in speaking on a student pannel about my summer internship at Microsoft. Initially I was pretty nervous because I couldn't see what I had to say that would be helpful to my peers. I was hesitant about accepting but did it anyway thinking “what the hell, why not”. Alark sent the questions beforehand and I attempted to script my answers the best I could, while also keeping it concise. The event went well, I answered the given questions and some random ones that occurred during the mini question and answer session. I didn’t see any impact that my answers had until after the event. A few people reached out to me and said how much they appreciated my sharing my experience (even though I didn’t think it was much), especially being the only woman on the panel. Hearing this impact, even if it wasn’t even remotely large really hit home. I was extremely glad that anything I had to share was helpful and this ties to my experience in my last event reflection. I’m not sure if this is a career path but definitely something I want to incorporate into my future. I think relaying information to folks (specifically women and POC) interested in a similar path as I am would hopefully create this domino effect I wish I was on the other end of. Sometimes hearing and seeing folks who look like you do great things is just the think push you needed, and it would be amazing to spread that feeling.
