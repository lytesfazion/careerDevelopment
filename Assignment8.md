# For this assignment, you are asked to summarize your experience meeting with your mentor; reflect on what you have learned from your mentor; and describe what you intend to discuss with your mentor in the future.

## Part 1: Summarize your interaction with your mentor so far. Provide an overview of the meetings you have had and the topics you have discussed.

Early on we established a few things that we want our meetings to be a safe space to talk about anything. In order for this to come to fruition, we though agreed we needed to be comfortable with eachother if we were gonna talk about ourselves. So we got to know eachother, and gave ourselve little structure so we didn't feel confined. 

For example: If I have specific questions or things I want to do with her I'll send an email before our meeting or just say it in the begining of the meeting. If nothing comes to me, we won't force it, and we'll just talk whatever flows.

To be specifc some of the toics we have spoken about are: 
- career aspirations
- Study/school/organization tips: Ranking tasks, time blocks, being realistic with yourself.
- setting boundaries 
- We talk about the future and why we are where we are today
- One meeting we talked about the ways our time at home during the pandemic is still affecting us.
- We've talked about things that held us back in the past and overcoming that.
- overall: work, school, hopes, dreams, future

## Part 2: Summarize at least three things you have learned from your mentor.

Like I mentioned before I asked my mentor about school related tips and these are a few of them:
1. It doesn't hurt to apply to things just for the experience of applying.
2. School/class tip: After a class write down everything you retained off memory. This gives you guidance later on what you really understood and what you need to study more.
3. Something else my mentor taught me was being realistic with myself. We talked about the perfect time to code and get work done and we talked about analyzing ourselves and noting when we get the most done. Based on that block times out of your schedule and get work done.


## Part 3: You are expected to continue your interaction with your mentor through the spring semester. Summarize the questions or topics you still hope to discuss with your mentor and your plan for continuing your relationship with your mentor.

In our last meeting we went through my resume and talked about applying to internships. So the next few meetings will probably surround interview practice and revisiting my resume with the edits I made.
