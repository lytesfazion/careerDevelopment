Consider the social identity wheel and discussion of Social Identity Groups described on this social identity wheel handout. 

Select at least two of the prompts that appear in the wheel and respond to them as part of your portfolio. You may choose more than two of the prompts. 

In addition to naming identities as required by the prompts, provide a short discussion of why you answered with those identities.


**question 1:** Identities I think about most often

**Answer 1:** I probably thnk of my race and ethnicity the most. For a long time I felt torn between my family ties to Eritrea and the home I've made in America. I felt that I was less Eritrean because I did not speak the laguage fluently and have only visited the country twice at very young ages. 
You would think since I felt less Eritrean that would mean I identified more with Americans, but sadly that was far from true.My parents were immigrants who were constantly trying to keep the culture alive so the only time I was exposed to american culture was in school. This made me culturally distant from other Black people. 
All that being said now that I am older I have found comfort in to space between the two but they are still the two identites I thnk about most often.

**question 2:** Identites that have the greatest effect on how others perceive you.

**Answer 2:** People still hold ignorant opinions about Black people and women, that is reflected in my interactions with folks and how they percieve me. 
  Sometimes I see it in the shock on faces when I speak of my acomplishments.
  Sometimes I hear the suprise in their voices when I voice my intrests.
  Sometimes this is because I am Black, sometimes it's because I'm a woman, others maybe both, but regardless I know that these external idenities play a massive role in how I am aproached and treated by others.
  
  **Why I answered these** : Honestly writing down my thoughts on idenity is pretty hard and these two were the only ones I could actually put into words how I felt.
