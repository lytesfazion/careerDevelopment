# Personal portfolio

Howdy 👋🏾

My name is Liwam (pronounced Lu-wam).
I am from Oakland California and I am studying computer science at the University of San Francisco.

As a part of my Career Development class we are creating personal portfolios and this is where I decided to build a home for mine. The repo will be made up of personal reflections, questions, and thoughts on my expreience as a mentee. 

Enjoy your journey through my mind!
