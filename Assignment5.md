**Define imposter syndrome in 1-2 paragraphs.**

Imposter syndrome is feeling like a fraud regardless of how successful you are. It is believing you acomplishments were due to some kind of glitch in the system or pure luck. It is the constant feeling of fear that you will be exposed because you don't deserve your title or position.

**Describe at least two approaches for combating imposter syndrome.**

  The main aproach showed in the video was to talk about it. When people voice their experiences it lead to finding community with others who are dealing with the same thing. The sharing can hopefully show they are not alone and disolve any imposter syndrome thoughts.
  
  In one of the articles I linked, it stated that a change in mindset can help. Instead of dwelling on your imposterism, think about how others whithout it react to challenges and practice their ways.
  
**In 300-500 words, reflect on a time you experienced or witnessed imposter syndrome. Describe the situation and how you addressed it.**

 This past summer I interned at Microsoft and as my sister likes to phrase it "the imposter syndrome is strong with this one". But let's backtrack to before I even started. The day I received the email filled with good news, I only remember celebrating for at least 10 minutes before all terrible thoughts flooded in at once. I said to myself :
  "why did they choose me?"
  "Are they trying to fill a quota?"
  "I messed up on one of the interview questions, there is no way I can work with Microsoft"
  "Did they pick me because I'm a Black woman? Let's be real, that's like a diversity diamond".
  
  And this was just the beginning. Although I was super excited for the opportunity I couldn't shake the thought that I didn't deserve to be there. I even felt weird about telling people about it. It made me feel like people would look at me in a way that I couldn't live up to. After months of dwelling on these feelings, I started my internship and the thoughts just got worse. I felt like my teammates (other interns) were way more experienced than me and I was just being carried by the team. 
  You ask how I addressed it. Well to be honest I still am. Over the summer I had an amazing set of mentors and once I got comfortable with them I shared what I was feeling. Their assurance that my thoughts were false was only temporary. And till this day I still feel weird about telling people about my summer and accomplishments. Even though the countless articles you read, say to talk about it, I’m not sure I agree. At least for me when I speak on it I just feel embarrassed and am met with comments on how I shouldn’t think that way.
