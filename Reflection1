3. If you were not interested in this type of work in high school: What type of career were you interested in pursuing?
  -> I didn't think I could go into computer science until my senior year. Before then I was pretty lost. Jumping from interest to interest, all I really knew was that I wanted to help people and enjoy my work. So the possibilities ranged from being a social worker to working on movies. Crazy right? Hence the reason why I was so confused.
  Since the later questions reference a list of jobs I was (before CS) interested in, here you go: 
      -Social Worker
      -Fire fighter
      -Lawyer
      -Movie Editor
      -Director
4. Why has your list changed since high school?
  -> The summer before my senior year I participated in Girls Who Code and it affirmed that this is where I wanted to be. Before then it was merely an idea rattling around in my head or a concept I joked about with my friends. 
  
8. What experiences contributed to your decision to pursue computer science?
   -> My parents were what some people might call technologically challenged so as their oldest child I had to step up and figure it out in order to help them. This was my window. It didn't have anything to do with programming, but I enjoyed being on the computer and figuring out how things work. I didn't really know what a computer science degree entailed, but that's where Girls who code kicked in.
   
9. How were you influenced by others?
  ->During my journey towards cs I had a friend who already decided she wanted to study computer science. She had an internship and took a summer class so while she worked on any of her projects I would just look over her shoulder. She tried to explain some things, but it just went over my head. That didn't bother me though, I was fascinated by all of it. Her enthusiasm influenced me to give cs a chance.
  
11. What did people close to you (Family/Teachers/Peers/ Culture) say to you as you were pursuing computer science and/or math, science, technology?
  ->My family and friends were pretty excited to hear that I decided on something to do.
